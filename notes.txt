just want to use this space for fooling around, not necessarily doing simulations or anything. 

maybe have an object which uses rules to spawn other, similar objects (like fractals in some fashion).  

You give it a starting color and position, and it just creates a picture for you.

could have a different object for each different path I want to draw...   each generation has a slightly different color and position and rotation.

each generation tries not to draw over anything (but don't want to just keep track of everything?  or do I?)

some objects can be linked:  Object A draws B, B draws C, C draws A, etc.


experiment with weird art stuff.
